# Node.js API with MongoDB

This project is a simple Node.js Express API that connects to a MongoDB database and retrieves user data. The GET endpoint /users/:id returns user details if the user exists and their age is greater than 21. Invalid ObjectId formats and missing users are gracefully handled.
